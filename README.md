# 🎨 Artist Style Classification with Deep Learning

This project investigates how well neural networks can interpret artistic style. Using transfer learning and image data augmentation, we train a deep convolutional neural network to classify paintings by famous artists.

The notebook `artist.ipynb` walks through every step — from preprocessing to prediction — using the **ResNet50** architecture and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of hundreds of paintings by 25 renowned painters. Each image filename encodes the artist's name (e.g., `Vincent_van_Gogh_13.jpg`). There is a separate test set for evaluation.

### 📥 Download Dataset

Download the dataset using the command below in your Google Colab environment:

!gdown 1-0d315aj7Ai8NNqat65XDvaOcHDcHiUD
!unzip famous_paintings.zip > /dev/null 2>&1

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **📦 Dataset Organization**: Images are automatically organized into class-based folders to streamline training.
- **🧹 Preprocessing**: Utilizes `image_dataset_from_directory` and `LabelEncoder` for efficient data loading and label encoding.
- **🧠 Transfer Learning**: Built upon the pre-trained `ResNet50` model for effective feature extraction.
- **🔄 Data Augmentation**: Enhances model robustness through random flipping, rotation, brightness, zoom, and contrast transformations.
- **🔧 Fine-Tuning**: Supports partial or full fine-tuning of the top `ResNet` layers to improve performance.
- **📊 Evaluation Metrics**: Measures performance using Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and Recall.
- **🔁 Class Mapping**: Ensures correct label-to-artist name mapping using `class_names` for accurate prediction outputs.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: `ResNet50` with `include_top=False` and `imagenet` pre-trained weights.
- **Classification Head**:
  - `GlobalAveragePooling2D`
  - Dense layers with `ReLU` activation
  - `BatchNormalization` and `Dropout` for regularization
  - Final output layer with `softmax` activation for multi-class classification
- **Optimizer**: Adam with:
  - Learning rate scheduling (`ReduceLROnPlateau`)
  - Early stopping (`EarlyStopping`) for optimal training convergence
